# Multiplication-Table-Game-Python
First Project in Python, Multiplication Table Training


I think there is not really much to say here. The game will ask you random multiplications from 1 to 9, this can be changed in the parentheses of firstValue and secondValue. I used the random module, as it is easy to use. The game can be ended by entering "00", this although only works after a correct answer. Couldn't figure it out myself, how it would also work in the while loop when given a wrong answer. So if you have any advice, message me.
